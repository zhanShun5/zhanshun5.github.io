                    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                    <p>I'M 24 years old
                        My first consol was a rip off version of a gameboy.
                        <br>
                        With seven I started to play Warcraft 3 on my cousins laptop.
                        Since then almost every year, I replay the main campain.
                        <br>
                        Most of my games can be played on my <a href="https://honigcake.itch.io"  target="_blank">Itch.io</a>, otherwise
                        <br>
                        <b>Click on one of the icons below to learn about some games I've made or or that are still in development.</b>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Motivation</h2>
                    <p>Having quit my previousely soul wretching studies made me realize that I want to make all sorts of art instead.</p>
                    <p>
                        And for me games are the ideal medium to achive this desire, since they encapsulate a vaste varity of art disciplies, such as Arts, Writing, and Music (to name the most forward ones).
                    </p>
                    <p>Since then I've started to have a 9to5 (somethimes 12to5) practicing game development and everything around it. 
                        [And I admit, It wasn't uncommon for me at the begining to even dream about Godot's script manager or placing tiles on the girdmap.]
                        <br>
                        Through my previouse study and various coding projects I've learned to maintain clean code and have a wide understanding of coding. 
                        As well as being comfortable with learning new programing languages and applications.
                        <br>
                        Music is most of the times my form of meditation. When making a track I tend to go with the Einstellung : "As long as it sounds good and fits.". Understanding that Music Theory is merely a suggestion. ==\[Leave out last sentence?==]
                        I tried myself on differnt genres, however, I feel the most comfortable with tracks that emit an ambient vibe to them. 
                        Attempting to resemble the soundtrack of 'Disco Elysium' and 'Who's Lila'. 
                        <br>
                        Although, creating Visuals, such as your own sprites and larger and more complex 3D models, are still not an ability I'm too comfortable with, <br> yet are on the top of my priority list.</p>

                                A story-driven and text-heavy game about deciding to help those less fourtunate than us, without the certanty of a return, from the perspective of a motel owner.
                               
                                <br>
                                You'll manage choosing if you want to gather the daily rent of your inhabitants or to take pity and let some of them off the hook, for today, while you yourself are under the loom of your own quota.
                                <br>
                                While collecting rent or checking up on the residents you inavitably will be confronted with their stories from the distance of a door that looks in from the outside. 

                                <br>
                                <br>

                                    Not so proudly are you the owner of a dusty hotel from the 70ties. Lucky for you, the wallpapers never needed to be changed since then and they
                                    gained a tint of yellow only comparable to madness and/or vomit.
                                    <br>
                                    The rooms held shut by dark oak doors and those held firmly by rusting doorhandles.
                                    Each door equiped with a mailbox that has things exiting it more then it enteres. 
                                    <br>
                                    And the most important feature of the motel:

                                The core idea is to maintain a balance between the moods of all the inhabitants whilst also not neglecting your own goals.
                                Worsing the tenants moods, by consequently asking for rent or by being rude towards them or through outside factors, will cause them to either leave completly or refuse to pay and denying to leave. 
                                <br>
                                When a mood reaches it's ciritcal low it triggers their unqiue event, refered to as <b>'Threshold'</b> 
                                <br>
                                which if not or poorly resolve will cause losing portions of your wealth, remove a differnt occupint or strongly affect the mood of others,
                                <br> 
                                causing a potential snowball effect of other tenants reaching their Threshold.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                So carful manovering the dialogues, getting to know the inhabitants on a deeper level, and planing out your finances will be mandatory strategies.
                                <br>
                                The player would need to do this for 5-7 sequences/days.

                                At the start of the game 8 out of 16 characters are chosen and randomly placed into rooms.
                                To move and knock from door to door the game uses Gridbased movement.
                                
                                <br>
                                You're limited to talk to specific amounts of people (would be indicated through a energy bar) and the current amount of money that a tenatn has, which varies for each one. 
                                <br>

                                <br>
                                1. You don't meet the quota at the end of the end of the week
                                <br>
                                2. You don't have any occupints in your room anymore.

                                <br>
                                <br>
                                
                                The main loop would consist of: <br>
                                - interact and talk with the people,<br>
                                    - see how they're doing in life<br>
                                    - uncovering their current financial situation and mood<br>
                                    - collect the full or half of the rent, or non of it<br>
                                Adjusting to outside events and maintaining a balance to not let the card house fall.
                                If you deem it nessecary for the mood of the others, then it's possible to throw out a tenant.

                                - how we deal with pitya to others
                                - how we see each other
                                - helping those in need
                                - being understanding of others less fortunate (the poor, the struggling)
                                
                                ### Living together in a cirel capatlaist work as those at rock botom
                                - Those at rock bottom, exploited and not benefited bya capatlism, are still exploiting each other.
                                - Pitya those people who are also suffering from capatalism as well

                                - ==Our actions (to help other) don't need to result in profit==
                                - People don't help other so much because theya don't think theya gain anyathing from it. 
                                - should teach taht helping others should not be with the expectation of profit
                                
                                - Gameplaya wise: 
                                    - yaou don't gain anyathing from helping others, rather yaou stop from losing something
                                    - helping people don't alwayas result in a profit
                                    - Rewarind with unconventional waya and not with moneya or bonsues etc.
                                        - ratehr with. INteractions? Stickers? Cosmetics? ==An apple in the office==?

                                - Landlord just need to "go around and collect moneya"
                                - no "real" effort from landlords
                                - Collecting moenya from hardworking dirt poor bluecollar workers

                                This is an incremental game that uses plant object on gridtiles to produce currency.
                                <br>
                                Fruther more you could also buy items (garden tools) to increase the yield or poduction efficeny of the plants.
                                <br>
                                However both items and plants take up limited space on the playarea, which other plants require to function the most optimaly.
                                <br>
                                Planing, organizing, and combining triple plants in your garden is required to make the most out of everything.

                                The game can be played on the browser and has a saving feature (only when downloaded).

                                The player will be planting plants, that get more expensive the more they buy, organizing them on the playarea, and wait for them to produce currency to buy more plants.
                                <br>
                                When the player get's tree of the same plants, it allows them to combine those to create a plant of a higher tier. 
                                <br>
                                The importance in planting the plants in the right spot lies in the way that the plants function.
                                <br>
                                For example: The yellow plant will trigger other plants in an area. 
                                <br>&emsp;&emsp;-Tier 1 will trigger a plant under it.
                                <br>&emsp;&emsp;-Tier 2 triggers left & right
                                <br>&emsp;&emsp;-Tier 3 in cross pattern
                                <br>&emsp;&emsp;-Tier 4 all tiles around the plant.  
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Items can be bought in the shop (colapsable on the right side of the screen) and are limited as well as
                                having different likelyhoods of appearing based on their rarity and the level of the shop. 
                                <br>
                                The ratio of rarity-shop level-likelyhood is based on that of 'Teamfight tactic'.
                                <br> 
                                Additionall, to make the early game easier, 'Sunshine' will fall, rewarding the player with currency upon click.
                                <br>
                                <br> 
                                After gaining a specified amount of currency, crows will start to appear. These crows, when landed on a plant, will stop the plant from working.
                                <br>
                                They will fly away when hovered over. An additional prevention is to get a scarecrow. Crows won't fly on the tiles the scarecrow is covering.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Further development plans are to create more plants, but also an additional resources, there furthermore, increasing the startegic possibilitieso of which resource to focuse on.
                                I'm also considered adding an addition play area. The player would switch from one play area to the other. In this playarea there would grow other stuff with different rules.

                                Incremental games main focuse lies in the feeling of progression. From making little currency to making exordinarly absurd amounts.
                                But feeling progression is not just clicking one button over and over and seeing numbers rise, it needs to feel desevered and earned, there needs to be time spent improving.

                                <b>Friction is needed.</b>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Fricion here is the limited space which is used for both plants and items.
                                <br>
                                Either lots of plants or lots of tools?
                                What do I remove to make space for the new objects?
                                <br>
                                The items and plants are contesting with each other as much as they work together.
                                But just like in real life, it's better to have a few good tools than have your sheed filled with junk.
                                <br>
                                Also, each bought plant increases the price of the next one, so that even later into the game, it isn't too easy to get new plants
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            Plants and tool are drawn by my Sister, the rest from an asset pack by <a href="https://sethbb.itch.io/">Sethbb</a>.
                            <br>
                            Plants were drawn in a differnt artstyle, since the asset pack plants meshed too much to the background, and to show the plants as interactable objects.

                                    - Either doubles the amount of customer that enter or spawn an additional one.
                                
                                - **Advertisment**

                                - **Product in stock**
                                    - How often the stand can sell something
                                    - to have a dilema between how much money the customers have and how much stock we have
                                
                                - some effects only affecting a certain type of customer?
                                - increasing the likelyhood of a specific type of customers to spawn?
                                
                                # Stands
                                
                                ## General notes
                                
                                 - Either have the unique action of the stand as a extra script exported by the resource
                                     - [x] Exported script on resource.
                                - Or have a function inside the res and match case based on the type of stand defined in the resource.
                                    - [ ] function defining action in resource
                                - Main (performance) issue is to consider:
                                    -  if it's better to have an extra Node holding functions
                                        - Clearer and better overview
                                        - allows us to add to the node or do stuff outside of the resource node
                                            - since the resource node can't acces the world?
                                    -  or if it's better for the functions to be and called in the resource
                                        - One less node over multiple stands/customers can be quite a lots of extra nodes
                                        - all in one place. No extra calles to other nodes need to be made, all in one.
                                
                                
                                ## Basic Stand
                                - Has mutliple tiers,
                                
                                ## Luxory Stand 
                                - Has low stock but high cost
                                - low chance to be bought
                                
                                ## Reliable Stand 
                                - Has good stock low cost 
                                - and good chance to be bought
                                
                                ## Wall Stand
                                
                                - Does nothing, just blocking
                                
                                ## Spooky stand
                                - Make the customer walk backwards for a while
                                    - Short duration
                                - set number of spookes
                                
                                ## Advertisement Stand
                                
                                - Does not need the customer to walk on it.
                                - Increases the amount of customers to walk in.
                                
                                ## Multiplier
                                - **One time use** (usage can be increased?)
                                - multiplies the customer by like 4
                                
                                ## More randoms stands
                                
                                - playing more with chances.
                                - like a 
                                
                                
                                
                                # Customer types
                                
                                Differnt customers?
                                
                                ## Jumpers
                                - Like air units, they jump over the obstacles, disregarding them
                                - Then we can have special stans that bind them
