                <p>
                    Creating art is the pursuit that I want to follow in life.
                    Games are the ideal medium to fulfill this desire since they encapsulate a vast variety of artistic disciplines such as visual arts, narrative writing, and musical composition (to name the most prominent).
                    Through this variety, game development is captivatingly complex, which allows one to learn and practice in so many fields of art. There will always be room to improve.

                        <div class="summary">                                A story-driven resource management PC game about helping those less fortunate than you, without the certainty of a return, from the perspective of a motel owner.
                                The player will manage gathering the daily rent of their inhabitants and consider their well-being, while they themselves are under the loom of their own quota.
                                <br>
                                While collecting rent or checking up on the residents the player inevitably will be confronted with their stories from the distance of a door that looks in from the outside. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This game is aimed at those who enjoy story-driven games where their choices matter and that lead to multiple different endings. 
                                It also strives to make each playthrough unique for each player based on their decisions.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The game is inspired by "The Yellow Wallpaper" and "No I'm not human".

                            <h1>Gameplay</h1>
                            <p>
                                The core idea is to maintain a balance between the moods of all the inhabitants whilst also not neglecting your own goals.
                                Pushing too hard for rent or being insensitive lowers their mood, potentially triggering negative consequences, such as them leaving completely or refusing to pay and leave. 
                                <br>
                                When a mood reaches its critical low it triggers their unique event, referred to as the <b>'Threshold'</b>,
                                <br>
                                which if not or poorly resolved can cause various issues, for example:
                                <br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>losing some of your wealth</li>
                                    <li>a different inhabitant leaves</li>
                                    <li>strongly affect the mood of others around</li>
                                    <li>a combination of them</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                                                        <p>
                                Causing a potential snowball effect of other tenants reaching their Threshold.
                                <br>
                                The limited mood forces the player to make more conscious choices and interactions with the characters, also the limited wealth of each inhabitant 
                                makes the most optimal tactic for the player to interact with <b>all</b> the characters.
                                <br>
                                So carefully maneuvering the dialogues, getting to know the inhabitants on a deeper level, and planning out your finances will be mandatory strategies.
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <h1>Interactions</h1>
                            <p>
                                The game unfolds over 5-7 in-game days, with each playthrough featuring 8 randomly selected tenants from a pool of 12 unique characters. 
                                <br>
                                Their placement, financial situations, and personal stories create unique scenarios in each game. 
                                <br>
                                Multiple endings reflect your management style and the relationships you build.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                An energy system and the current amount of money that they have, which varies for each one, restrict how many tenants you can interact with each day. 
                                <br>
                                By limiting actions per day the player needs to consider with whom they want to interact with and how much.
                                <br>
                                Emphasizes making the right decision-making.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                An aspect to consider is that not all "correct" interactions lead to a reward or positive outcome.
                                <br>
                                Sometimes the player is rewarded with something unconventional, like an apple at the office desk or stickers that do not affect the gameplay.

                            <h1>Dialogue, People, and Story</h1>
                            <p>
                                The main hardship in creating this game will be character dialogue, because of the number of characters in different thresholds and the inhabitants dialogue with each other. 
                                <br>
                                The current idea is to have each of the 12 characters have six <b>Moodpoints</b>, in which their dialogue would change based on their current mood.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The dialogue system would use a basket method, similar to that of 'Hades', to pick out dialogue lines and reuse them only once all the other lines have been used.
                                <br>
                                With "Inhabitant-Interaction-Lines", a line that only gets said if two or more specific inhabitants are in the current playthrough, being placed on top of the priority list.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Assuring for immersive conversations.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Characters</h2>
                            <p>
                                The characters are named after fictional characters who represent a type of mistery and/or suffering from societal injustice.
                                <br>
                                This helps set a foundation of who the characters are and a degree of familiarity. 
                                <br>
                                Some names used and where their misery stems from:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Semyon - "Crime and Punishment" -> Villianation of severe addiction</li>
                                <li>Joshep - "The Trial" -> Victims of scams</li>
                                <li>Ellen - "I have no mouth and I must scream" -> Intersectional Discrimination</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Core idea</h2>
                            <p> 
                                The player isn't supposed to 'solve' the issue of the characters.
                                <br>
                                I don't intend on creating a story that makes everyone live happily ever after, yet also not a story that leaves everyone as miserably as they started.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The problems these characters face aren't ones that can be solved over pep talks and friendly acts. These issues demand large changes in Social consciousness.
                                <br>
                                Rather, the dialogue and gestures of empathy are there to mend and support the characters and to spread awareness to the player to view those less fortunate with a more empathetic eye.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Ideally, this game helps the player to confront and see others with more compassion and care. 
                                <br>
                                In a world that can turn its back on you for the smallest of weakness, it's important that at least the people, that are so close to be in the same shoes, have one ear to spare.

                                This is a relaxing incremental game that can be played on the PC and Mobile, about using plant objects on grid tiles to produce currency. 
                                <br>
                                Furthermore, you can also buy items (garden tools) to increase the yield or production efficiency of the plants. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                However, both items and plants take up limited space on the play area, which other plants require to function the most optimally.
                                <br>
                                Planning, organizing, and combining triplets of plants is required to let your garden flourish.

                                The player will be planting plants, that get more expensive the more they buy, organizing them on the play area, and waiting for them to produce currency to buy more plants.
                                <br>
                                When the player gets three of the same plants, it allows them to combine those to create a plant of a higher tier. 
                                <br>
                                The importance of planting the plants in the right spot lies in the way that the plants function.
                                <br>
                                For example, the yellow plant will trigger other plants in an area. 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Tier 1: Will trigger a plant under it</li>
                                    <li>Tier 2: Triggers left & right</li>
                                    <li>Tier 3: In cross pattern</li>
                                    <li>Tier 4: All tiles around the plant</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Items can be bought in the shop (collapsable able on the right side of the screen) and are limited as well as
                                having different likelihoods of appearing based on their rarity and the level of the shop. 
                                <br>
                                The ratio between rarity-shop to level-likelihood is based on that of <b>'Teamfight tactic'</b>.
                                <br> 
                                Additionally, to make the early game quicker, 'Sunshine' will fall, rewarding the player with currency upon click.
                                <br>
                                <br> 
                                After gaining a specified amount of currency, crows will start to appear. These crows, when landed on a plant, will stop the plant from working.
                                <br>
                                They will fly away when hovered over. An additional prevention is to get a scarecrow. Crows won't fly on the tiles the scarecrow is covering.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Further development plans are to create more plants, but also additional resources, furthermore increasing the strategic possibilities.
                                <br>
                                As well a prestige system. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I'm also considered adding an addition play area. The player would switch from one play area to the other. In this play area there would grow other stuff with different rules.
                                <br>

                            Incremental game's main focus lies in the feeling of progression. From making little currency to making extraordinary absurd amounts of currency.
                            But feeling progression is not just clicking one button over and over and seeing numbers rise, it needs to feel deserved and earned, and there needs to be time spent improving. 
                            <br>
                            <b>Friction is needed.</b>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Friction here is the limited space that is used for both plants and items.
                            <br>
                            Either lots of plants or lots of tools?
                            What do I remove to make space for the new objects?
                            The items and plants are competing with each other as much as they work together.
                            But just like in real life, it's better to have a few good tools than have your sheed filled with junk.
                            <br>
                            Also, each bought plant increases the price of the next one, so that even later into the game, it isn't too easy to get new plants.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Plants and tools are drawn by my Sister, the rest from an asset pack by <a href="https://sethbb.itch.io/">Sethbb</a>.
                            <br>
                            Plants were drawn in a different art style since the asset pack plants meshed too much to the background, and to highlight the plants as interactable objects.
                            <br>

                                Construct a maze-like structure to direct the customer wave to walk past your shop stands.

                                Each stand that get's passes by a customer has a chance to activate (the customer buys the product).

                                With each stand having a limited amount of products for each week.

                                A stand can have various effects, from simply adding points, to pushing the customer back a few tiles, to duplicating the customer.

                                Positioning of the stands is key since later on the points reach astronomically high, 
                                the player needs to fully use stands, push the customers back, force them into a loop (for a while), and manipulate the odds, to achieve the point quota.
                                <br>
                                Leaving an unintentional gap opens up a new path for the customers to walk through and potentially skip important point-winning stands.
                                <br>
                                Each point counts, afterall, you'll have a weekly quota to meet.
                                <br> 
                                But luckly, your previously earned points/money follows you into the next weeks.  
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                An option for a longer session may exist, extending the play area on both sides by 8x8 tiles.

                                Also increasing the needed weekly quota.

                        Sorting the emails, by dragging and dropping them in the bin or into a folder, and hiring proper applicants.

                        However, as the CEO announces that they're leaving, you'll attempt to cause as much havoc as possible, by deleting important emails and hiring unqualified applicants, 
                        until the CEO returns back. Playable <a href="https://honigcake.itch.io/all-in-a-days-work">here</a>.
