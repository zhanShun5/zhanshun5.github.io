                    <p>
                        Creating art is the pursuit that I want to follow in life

                                A story-driven resource management PC game about helping those less fortunate than you, without the certantiy of a return, from the perspective of a motel owner.
                                <br>
                                The player will manage gathering the daily rent of their inhabitants and considering their well being, while they themselves are under the loom of their own quota.
                                <br>
                                While collecting rent or checking up on the residents the player inevitably will be confronted with their stories from the distance of a door that looks in from the outside. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This game is aimed at those who enjoy story-driven games where their choices matter and that lead to multiple different endings.
                                As well as aims to make each playthrough unique for each player based on their decisions.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The game is inspired by "The yellow wallpaper" and "No I'm not human". 
                                <br>
                                It also uses Gridbased movement and a locked camera.

                            <h2>Threshold</h2>
                            <p>
                                The core idea is to maintain a balance between the moods of all the inhabitants whilst also not neglecting your own goals.
                                Pushing too hard for rent or being insensitive lowers their mood, potentially triggering negative consequences, such as them leaving completly or refuse to pay and leave. 
                                <br>
                                When a mood reaches it's critical low it triggers their unique event, refered to as <b>'Threshold'</b> 
                                <br>
                                which if not or poorly resolve can cause various issues, for example:
                                <br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>losing some of your wealth</li>
                                    <li>a different inhabitant leaves</li>
                                    <li>strongly affect the mood of others around</li>
                                    <li>a combination of them</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                causing a potential snowball effect of other tenants reaching their Threshold.
                                <br>
                                The limited mood forces the player to make more consious choices and interactions with the characters, also
                                through the limited wealth of each inhabitant, makes the most optimal tactic for the player to interact with <b>all</b> the characters.
                                <br>
                                So careful maneuvering the dialogues, getting to know the inhabitants on a deeper level, and planning out your finances will be mandatory strategies.
                                <br>
                            </p>

                            <h2>Interactions</h2>
                            <p>
                                The game unfolds over 5-7 in-game days, with each playthrough featuring 8 randomly selected tenants from a pool of 12 unique characters. 
                                Their placement, financial situations, and personal stories create unique scenarios each game. Multiple endings reflect your management style and the relationships you build.
                                <br>
                                An energy system and the current amount of money that a they have, which varies for each one, restricts how many tenants you can interact with each day. 
                                <br>
                                By limiting actions per day the player needs to consider with whom they want to interact with and how much.
                                <br>
                                Again, emphasizing right decisions making and turning dialogues into a resource.
                                <br>
                                An apect to consider, is that not all interactions lead to a rewarding, but rather help you from losing resources.
                                <br>
                                Sometimes the player is rewarded with something unconventional, like an apple at the office desk or stickers.

                                The main hardship of the creation of this game will be the characters dialogue, for the sheer quantity and the inhabitant dialogue with each other.
                                The current idea is to have each of the 12 characters have six <b>Moodpoints</b>, in which their dialogue would change based on their current moode.
                                <br>
                                It would use a basket method, similar to that of 'Hades', to pick out dialogue lines and reuse them only once all the other lines have been used.
                                <br>
                                With "Inhabitant-Interaction-Lines", a line that only get's said if two or more specific inhabitants are in the current playthrough, being placed ontop the priority list. 
                                <br>
                                Assuring for immersive conversations.

                            <h2>Characters</h2>
                            <p>
                                The characters are named after fictional character who represent a type of mistery and/or suffering from socicetal injustice.
                                This helps set a fondation of who the characters are and a degree of familiarity.
                                Some names used and where their misery stems from: 
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Semyon - "Crime and Punsihment" -> Villianation of severly addicted</li>
                                <li>Joshep - "The Trial" -> Victims of scams</li>
                                <li>Ellen - "I have no mouth and I must scream" -> Intersectional Discrimination</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                <br>  
                                The player isn't supposed to 'solve' the issue of the characters. 
                                <br>
                                I don't intend on creating a story that makes everyone life happily, yet also not a story that leaves everyone as miserably as they started.
                                <br>
                                The problems that these characters face aren't ones that can be solved over peptalks and friendly conversation. These demand large changes in Social consciousness.
                                <br>
                                Rather, the dialogue and gestures of empathy are there to mend and support the characters and to sheed awarness for the player.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <h2>Core idea</h2>
                            <p>
                                Ideally, this game helps the player to confront and see others with more compassion and care. 
                                <br>
                                In a world that can turn it's back on you for the smallest of weakness, it's important that atleast the people, that are so close to be in the same shoes, have one ear to spare.

                                This is a relaxing incremental game that can be played on the PC and Mobile, about using plant object on grid tiles to produce currency. 
                                <br>
                                Furthermore you could also buy items (garden tools) to increase the yield or production efficiency of the plants. 
                                <br>
                                However both items and plants take up limited space on the play-area, which other plants require to function the most optimal.
                                <br>
                                Planning, organizing, and combining triple plants in your garden is required to make the most out of everything.

                                The player will be planting plants, that get more expensive the more they buy, organizing them on the playarea, and wait for them to produce currency to buy more plants.
                                <br>
                                When the player get's tree of the same plants, it allows them to combine those to create a plant of a higher tier. 
                                <br>
                                The importance in planting the plants in the right spot lies in the way that the plants function.
                                <br>
                                For example: The yellow plant will trigger other plants in an area. 
                                <br>&emsp;&emsp;-Tier 1 will trigger a plant under it.
                                <br>&emsp;&emsp;-Tier 2 triggers left & right
                                <br>&emsp;&emsp;-Tier 3 in cross pattern
                                <br>&emsp;&emsp;-Tier 4 all tiles around the plant.

                                Items can be bought in the shop (colapsable on the right side of the screen) and are limited as well as
                                having different likelyhoods of appearing based on their rarity and the level of the shop. 
                                <br>
                                The ratio of rarity-shop level-likelyhood is based on that of <b>'Teamfight tactic'</b>.
                                <br> 
                                Additionall, to make the early game easier, 'Sunshine' will fall, rewarding the player with currency upon click.
                                <br>
                                <br> 
                                After gaining a specified amount of currency, crows will start to appear. These crows, when landed on a plant, will stop the plant from working.
                                <br>
                                They will fly away when hovered over. An additional prevention is to get a scarecrow. Crows won't fly on the tiles the scarecrow is covering.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Further development plans are to create more plants, but also an additional resources, there furthermore, increasing the startegic possibilitieso of which resource to focuse on.
                                I'm also considered adding an addition play area. The player would switch from one play area to the other. In this playarea there would grow other stuff with different rules.

                                Incremental games main focuse lies in the feeling of progression. From making little currency to making exordinarly absurd amounts.
                                But feeling progression is not just clicking one button over and over and seeing numbers rise, it needs to feel desevered and earned, there needs to be time spent improving.

                                Fricion here is the limited space which is used for both plants and items.

                                Either lots of plants or lots of tools?
                                What do I remove to make space for the new objects?
                                The items and plants are contesting with each other as much as they work together.
                                But just like in real life, it's better to have a few good tools than have your sheed filled with junk.
                                <br>
                                Also, each bought plant increases the price of the next one, so that even later into the game, it isn't too easy to get new plants
                                <br>

                                Plants and tool are drawn by my Sister, the rest from an asset pack by <a href="https://sethbb.itch.io/">Sethbb</a>.
                                <br>
                                Plants were drawn in a different artstyle, since the asset pack plants meshed too much to the background, and to show the plants as interactable objects.

                                <br> 
                                Each stand that get's passed by a customer has a chance to activate (customer buys the product).
                                With each stand having a limited amount of products for each wave.
                                <br>
                                A stand can have variouse effects, from simply adding points, to pushing the customer back a few tiles, to duplicating the customer.

                                Positioning of the stands is key, since later on the points reach astronomacly high, 
                                the player needs to fully use stands push the customers back or force them into a loop (for a while), and manipulating the odds, to achive the point goals.
                                <br>
                                Leaving a gap block opens up a new unintentional path for the customers to walk through and potential skip important point-winning stands.
                                <br>
                                Each point counts, afterall, you'll have a weekly quota to fullfil.

                                A option for a longer session may exist, extending the playarea on both sides by 8x8 tiles.

                                Also increasing the needed weekly quota.
